Hi, Tom. I'm Jonathan from Solar Savings Alliance. How are you doing today? I'm good. 

How are you? I'm doing well. Thank you for asking. I noticed that you recently filled out a form on Facebook showing interest in our Zero Down Solar Programme, so I wanted to reach out and personally thank you for your interest.

(0:16 - 0:23)
Has anyone had a chance to speak with you about this programme yet? Not yet. Great. I'm glad I could connect with you today.

(0:23 - 0:35)
Let me give you a brief overview of our Zero Down Solar Programme. This programme allows homeowners like you to instal solar panels with no upfront costs. If you qualify, you could start saving on your monthly energy bills right away and be protected from future rate increases.

It's a fantastic opportunity to reduce your energy expenses and contribute to a greener environment. Would it be okay if I asked you a few quick questions to see if you qualify for the programme? Yeah, but how much is this going to cost? I completely understand your concern about the cost. With our Zero Down Solar Programme, there are no upfront costs for qualified homeowners.

The programme is designed to help you switch to solar power without any initial payment. Any remaining balance after incentives and rebates can be covered by a monthly payment that is likely equal to or less than your current electric bill. Plus, once the system is paid off, you'll own it outright and won't have to worry about future rate increases.

It's a great way to save money in the long run. Would you be open to answering a few questions to see if you qualify for these benefits? Sure. That's fantastic, Tom.

(1:19 - 1:31)
Let's start with the qualifying questions to see if you're eligible for our Zero Down Solar Programme. Firstly, are you currently spending more than $100 per month on your average electricity bill? Yes, I am. Great to know, Tom.

(1:31 - 1:41)
Who is your current electric provider? South Central Power. Thank you for sharing that, Tom. Is your home a single-family residence? Yes, it is.

(1:42 - 1:48)
That's good to know, Tom. Are you the homeowner of the property? Yes, I am. Perfect, Tom.

(1:48 - 2:01)
Do you have any trees that shade your roof? I do. If the trees are on your property, there are available funds for tree trimming or removal, so we can take care of that for you. Let's continue with the questions to see how we can best assist you.

(2:02 - 2:14)
What type of roof do you have, shingles or tile? They're shingles. Thank you for sharing that, Tom. Is your roof in good condition? It's 25 years old, so no.

(2:15 - 2:27)
Thank you for letting me know, Tom. Is your credit score 650 or better? Would that be an issue for you? Would what be an issue? I apologise for any confusion, Tom. I was referring to your credit score.

(2:28 - 2:40)
In order to determine your eligibility for the Zero Down Solar Programme, we need to know if your credit score is 650 or better. Would you happen to know your credit score? It is not 650 or better. Thank you for letting me know, Tom.

(2:40 - 2:49)
Can you please verify your address so we can send the energy expert to the correct location? I understand, Tom.
