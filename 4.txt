Hi, this is Sam with Tennessee Homebuyers. How can I help you today? Hi, I need to sell my house. Okay, yeah, absolutely. I can help with that. Can I get your name? Samantha. Nice to meet you, Samantha. What's the address of the property you're looking to sell? It is 123 Main Street. Gotcha, thank you. And what city and zip code is that in? It's in Murfreesboro 37127. Perfect, thank you for that. So Samantha, what's going on with the house? What made you decide to reach out?  Um,  I need to get it sold. I'm getting a divorce. Oh gosh, I'm really sorry Samantha, that's such a heavy thing to be going through and then having to deal with the house on top of it is just a lot. I hear you. We'll take this one step at a time. Okay. No pressure at all. Is the divorce finalized already?  Um, no, it's not finalized yet. Okay, gotcha. That makes sense. That limbo part is really hard, you know? So it sounds like you're trying to get the house taken care of before everything is finalized then.  Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. I really appreciate it. So to make sure we can give you the most accurate info when someone comes out, let me ask you a few quick things about the house if that's okay. um How many bedrooms and bathrooms does it have? It's  a two bed one bath. Gotcha, thank you. And about how many square feet is it? Even a rough idea is totally fine. It's like 1500 square feet. Got it, thanks. And do you know roughly when it was built? I have no idea. No problem at all, that's totally fine. And is it a single family home or is it like a townhouse or condo? It's a townhouse. Gotcha. Thanks for that. And how would you describe the overall condition of the place right now?  Um,  eh, it's fine. I'll probably use some updating. Okay, that makes sense. Kind of livable, but dated. Are there any major repairs needed that you know of?  Um,  not nothing major that I know. think it just really would need to be  updated. Gotcha. Thank you for explaining that and are there any special features worth mentioning? Anything like a garage, patio, end unit, anything like that?  Um oh No, nothing like that. Okay, no worries, and is anyone living there right now? Yeah, I am. Okay, got it. Thanks. And do you have a mortgage on the place? Roughly what do you owe, if you know?  Um, yeah, I owe like a hundred and fifteen maybe on it though. Okay, gotcha. Thanks for sharing that. And last thing here, what are you hoping to get for it? Totally okay if it's just a ballpark right now. I have no idea. No problem at all. That's totally fine. A lot of people aren't sure yet, especially with everything else you've got going on. So based on what you've told me, I really think it helped to have one of our team members come out and take a look in person. They can walk the place, talk through options with you and give you a clear idea of what selling could look like. No pressure to decide anything on the spot. What does your schedule look like? We could have someone stop by tomorrow or the day after. What do you have available? Okay, I'm back, so we actually don't have anything for tomorrow. Well, I'd say you'll what? But I do have a few good options right after that we could do Tuesday at 10 a.m. or Tuesday at 12 p.m. Which of those would work better for you, Samantha?  I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you say that again for me? Yeah, 10 a.m. Perfect, thank you. So I have you down for Tuesday, January 20th at 10 a.m. at 123 Main Street, Murfreesboro, 1337127. Caleb will be the one coming out to meet with you and walk through everything. Does that all sound right? Okay, yep, sounds good. Okay, awesome. I've got you down for Tuesday at 10 a.m. at 123 Main Street, Murfreesboro 37127 and Caleb will be the one coming out to meet with you. Samantha, um thank you so much for trusting me with all of this today. I know the divorce stuff especially is just a lot to carry and I really appreciate you being open with me. This visit is just about giving you clarity and options. um Fans, no pressure at all. We're here to support you however you need, okay? Take care and we'll see you Tuesday. All right, thanks. Bye bye.
