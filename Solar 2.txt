Hey Jackson. Hello, who's this? Hey, this is Jesse calling from SolarSphere. How have you been? I'm doing good, how are you? I'm doing great, thanks for asking.

(0:08 - 0:15)
Just reaching out to talk to you about the electrical meter that was installed on 506 Woodrow Road. That's your property, right? That's right. Great.

(0:15 - 0:24)
So over the last few years, they've upgraded everyone's meter from analog to digital. And because of that, a program called Net Metering was formed. It's the reason for this call on a recorded line.

(0:25 - 0:30)
Has anybody come by to talk to you about this program yet? No, they haven't. Got it. So let me explain the program to you.

(0:31 - 0:42)
Not everyone qualifies, but the federal government has put incentives in place that allow you to eliminate all electric bills and replace them with a cheaper fixed rate. It's kind of like a bill swap. You effectively put tens of thousands back into your pocket.

(0:42 - 0:51)
But to check if you qualify, how much are you currently paying for your electric bill each month? About $240. Wow, that's quite a bill. You are definitely a good candidate for the program.

(0:51 - 1:00)
We can set up a free consultation call with one of our reps. Whether you decide to go solar or not, we just want to provide you with the information to help. What time zone are you in? I'm in eastern time.

(1:00 - 1:08)
Okay, eastern time. What time between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. works best for you tomorrow? I could do 11.30. Perfect. I'll lock in that time for you.

(1:09 - 1:19)
So just to confirm, our appointment will be at 11.30 a.m. eastern time tomorrow. By the way, is there anyone else who will be involved in making this decision, like a spouse or a partner? Yeah, my wife will be on there. Got it.

(1:20 - 1:28)
It's always good to have everyone involved. Just to double check, there's no reason you or your wife would miss this call at 11.30 a.m. eastern time tomorrow, right? Nope. We should be good.

(1:29 - 1:32)
Okay, amazing. So I have all the information I need. Thanks again.

(1:32 - 1:42)
Please remember to be available for our solar technicians who will be going around the community to provide you with more information. Also, you should receive a text asking you to send a utility bill. This will just make the visit a lot faster.

(1:42 - 1:46)
So if anything changes, feel free to text that number. Have a good day. All right.

(1:46 - 1:47)
Thanks, Jesse. See you tomorrow.
